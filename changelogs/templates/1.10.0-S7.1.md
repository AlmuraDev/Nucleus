# Note: Forcing modules to load

Note that there are now plugins that are being created that ask Nucleus to disable a module as it provides
replacement functions (for example, DuskMultiSpawn replacing the Spawn module). If you want to force a module 
to load regardless, set the module to FORCELOAD in the modules section of main.conf.

A recap of the module states:

* DISABLED - module will not load
* ENABLED - module will load unless another plugin requests for it to not be loaded
* FORCELOAD - module will load, even if another plugin requests for it to not be loaded

# API updates

## Added `NucleusNoteEvent`

As requested by the community, I've added a `NucleusNoteEvent.Created` for tracking when a note is created.

# Minor Updates

## Added simple way to try to overwrite what mods might do to chat

If you're struggling with mods potentially overwriting chat, try checking your mods for options to disable
that behaviour. However, if you can't find that options, try setting `chat.overwrite-mod-changes` to `true`.
Nucleus will attempt to revert any changes that mods make to the chat. 

It is advised to keep this off unless necessary. 

# Bugfixes

*  Fix NPE when attempting to disable modules programmatically.
