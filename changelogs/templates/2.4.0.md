# API Changes

## Added  `NucleusTextTemplate#getBody(CommandSource... sender)` and companion methods

In order to support sending broadcasts to Discord when using MagiBridge, the `NucleusTextTemplate` that is returned from `NucleusTextTemplateEvent#getMessage()` now has a set of `getBody` methods to support getting unprefixed messages.

## Added `isFirstJoin` to `NucleusKitEvent.Redeem`

This allows plugin developers to know if a kit is being redeemed because a player has joined for the first time (at least as far as Nucleus is concerned).

# Minor Changes

* First join kits with commands will now have their commands executed a tick later to ensure that the player has completely joined.
