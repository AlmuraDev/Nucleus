# Compatibility Note

It has recently been discovered that one or two plugins contain a project known as "Configurate But With Blackjack And Hookers". This project tries to extend the Configurate system's Object Mapper, but does so in a dangerous, unsupported and hacky way - so much so that it stops other plugins from using some of their own advanced object mappers. As you may have guessed, Nucleus is severely impacted by this.

For technical details, you can read more about the issue below: 

* https://github.com/NucleusPowered/Nucleus/issues/1492
* https://github.com/Sponge-RPG-dev/ConfigurateButWithBlackjackAndHookers/issues/1

If you use NT-RPG or related plugins, you should upgrade Nucleus now or stop using the plugins that include these hacks. It is likely that Nucleus was not working correctly in the first place, but this should work around the issue. You will know if you've been impacted when running this version, Nucleus will print a large message on start up to tell you what is happening.

If you develop a plugin that uses its own object mapper, you will also be impacted by this issue.
