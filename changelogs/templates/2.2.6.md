# Upgrading to Nucleus 2 from Nucleus 1.x

**Nucleus v1 is now UNSUPPORTED. It is recommended that you upgrade to this version as soon as practical. Note that some plugins may not be compatible with Nucleus v2.**

[Please read the Nucleus 2.0.1 release notes before upgrading.](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Nucleus/Nucleus/versions/2.0.1)

For the things YOU need to do as a server owner, [please visit our instructions on how to upgrade](https://v2.nucleuspowered.org/docs/howto/migrate.html).

# Removed the ability for Nucleus to set up groups

This refers to the command `/nucleus setupperms -g`. DO NOT USE THIS FUNCTION IN EARLIER VERSIONS. It basically got the permission group setup backwards.
After some thought, I've decided that it's not worth me having such a function - users should set up the permissions plugins themselves and get comfortable with them.
