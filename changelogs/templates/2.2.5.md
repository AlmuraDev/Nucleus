# Upgrading to Nucleus 2 from Nucleus 1.x

**Nucleus v1 is now UNSUPPORTED. It is recommended that you upgrade to this version as soon as practical. Note that some plugins may not be compatible with Nucleus v2.**

[Please read the Nucleus 2.0.1 release notes before upgrading.](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Nucleus/Nucleus/versions/2.0.1)

For the things YOU need to do as a server owner, [please visit our instructions on how to upgrade](https://v2.nucleuspowered.org/docs/howto/migrate.html).

# IMPORTANT: Kit Migration

It turns out that the kit migration was faulty in v2. This has now been rectified. It is recommended that you backup your `nucleus/kits.json` file before installing
this update.

The migrator will attempt to do the following:

* If you do not have a `kits` section in your json file, the migrator will do nothing.
* If you **only** have a `kits` section in your json file, the migrator will convert your kits into the v2 format.
* If you have both a `kits` section AND other kits already created, the migrator will do nothing, but warn you when the file is loaded.

Apologies for any inconvenience.

# Bug Fixes

* Fix kits migration from v1 to v2.
* Reduce chance that user data is not saved if a player is idle for more than five minutes.
