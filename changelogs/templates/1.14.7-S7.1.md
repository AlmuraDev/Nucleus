# IMPORTANT

This is expected to be the **LAST** Nucleus v1 release. Nucleus v1 should now be considered at its end of life and, unless we have introduced a bug in this release, there
will be no more v1 versions. v1 will recieve no more support, and everyone is encouraged to move to the v2 series when practical.  

# Permission Adjustments

* The permission `nucleus.inventory.keepondeath` is no longer assigned to any group (it was previously assigned to the ADMIN role group/`nucleus.admin` permission). If you want this permission, you must grant it manually.
* Added offline player to online player teleportation via `/tp`.

# Bugfixes

* Fixed `/enchant --unsafe` not respecting the admin role permission.
* Don't attempt to edit the dimension ID of a world on import, just delete it and let the server deal with it.
