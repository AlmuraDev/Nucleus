# Upgrading to Nucleus 2 from Nucleus 1.x

**Nucleus v1 is now UNSUPPORTED. It is recommended that you upgrade to this version as soon as practical. Note that some plugins may not be compatible with Nucleus v2.**

[Please read the Nucleus 2.0.1 release notes before upgrading.](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Nucleus/Nucleus/versions/2.0.1)

For the things YOU need to do as a server owner, [please visit our instructions on how to upgrade](https://v2.nucleuspowered.org/docs/howto/migrate.html).

# New Features

## Command Logger now show more of the cause of a command

Now, when a command is executed, any plugins and command sources in the cause stack will be shown in the command log. For an example, say the 
server runs `/sudo Player ping`, the following will be displayed in the logger:

```
sudo Player ping
[nucleus]: Server ran the command: /sudo Player ping
Forcing Player to run the command "/ping".
[nucleus]: [ Server -> (plugin) Nucleus -> ] Player ran the command: /ping
```

In the last message, the Server ran `/sudo`, which is a Nucleus command, which forces the player "Player" to run `/ping`.

This should hopefully make it clearer for admins to understand why a command is being executed.

## The Warning module is now removed, with the NucleusWarningService deprecated

Nucleus will no longer warn users that the warning module has been removed. The `NucleusWarningService` is now part of the Core module, and has 
been deprecated.
