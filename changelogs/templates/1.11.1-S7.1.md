# Minor Updates

* Allow modifying when the cooldown is trigged for `/tpa` to when `/tpa` is run, rather than if a teleport is accepted.

# Bug Fixes

* Fix issue where world unloads were happening a tick later than they should have been
* Remove mod bypass listener (as it was based on a faulty assumption and didn't work anyway)
